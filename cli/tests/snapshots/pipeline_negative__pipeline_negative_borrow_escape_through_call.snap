- Error: [M203] Borrow error in bad_escape closure 0: borrowed value does not live long enough: local _2 dropped while still borrowed at block 1 statement 3
  help: ensure the borrowed value outlives all references to it
  note: loan issued at block 0 statement 1 (place _2, kind Shared, region '2, holder _3)
  note: region '2 is live at block 1 statement 3 because '2 >= '4 >= '5 >= '1 ('1 is required to be live here)
